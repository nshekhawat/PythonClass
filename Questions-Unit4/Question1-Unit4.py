Perform a list assignment using the Python command line to assign the first 4 prime numbers 2,3,5 and 7 to a list called primes.
Hint: you will need to use square brackets [] to assemble the list.
- Append the 5th prime number (11) to this list using the append() method. Print out the primes list
- Create another list called: b of the 6th to the 8th prime numbers ( which are 13, 17 and 19).
Add b to the end of primes to create a new list c (adding primes and b together using the + operator).
Write what happens when you print c.
- Append the list b to the end of the list primes (using the append() method ).
(Explanation: a list item can itself be a list in Python).
- Print the value primes[5][2] . If you carried out the above exercises correctly this should print the value 19.
Experiment with other indexes so that you print 17 or 13 in a similar way.
